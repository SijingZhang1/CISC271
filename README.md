## CISC271

Projects completed in CISC271.

# Linear Regression & Cross-Validation Analysis — MATLAB 
– Developed a linear regression model to analyze a matrix dataset. \
– Implemented data standardization and 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability. \
– Identified the best predictor variable with the lowest RMS error. \

# Graph Clustering Using Fiedler Vector — MATLAB 
– Utilized the Fiedler vector of a Laplacian matrix to cluster graph vertices into two sets. \
– Implemented in MATLAB, the project involved initializing the Laplacian matrix and clustering vertices 
using a for loop. \
– Visualized results with rectilinear and clustered graphs, demonstrating effectiveness on small datasets
while highlighting limitations with larger data
